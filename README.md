# ValidationSytem
 an Engine that is always running during the life-time of a process, making that process always capable and ready to carry out validation on data. 
 Because different data-types may need validation(e.g. int, char *),  implementation is tried to be achieved using generic programming. 
 Validation parallelism is also tried to be accomplished!. To me, C++ sounds like a very good language-choice, condering it meeting the criteria, and is exactly the language I'd like to implement the system in.
 I've being doing some play-arounds with PHP and implemented a fully functional synchronous prototype. Though its synchronous, it illustrates the whole concept. Only concurrency is what's missing in the picture.
 Check it out in the 'PHP' directory. Still working on the documentation and will definately put it out soon.
 Designing the C++ version is a go! and, hopefully, implementation will start soon.
